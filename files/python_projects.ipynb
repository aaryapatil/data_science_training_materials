    "\n",
    "Thanks to how Python handles imports and modules, it is relatively easy to structure a Python project. There are only a limited set of constraints to structure a module in python. Therefore, you can focus on the pure architectural task of crafting the different parts of your project and their interactions. Python modules are one of the main abstraction layers and a natural one. Abstraction layers allow separating code into components, holding related data and functionality together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one component can handle reading and writing the data from/to a remote database, while another deals with the complex training of your neural network model. The most natural way to separate these two is to regroup all I/O functionality in one file, and the training operations in another. The training file may import the I/O file through `import ...` or `from ... import A, B, C`.\n",

    "### Packages in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a straightforward packaging system that extends the module mechanism to a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any directory with an `__init__.py` file is considered a Python package. The package's modules (python files) obey the import rules mentioned before. Only the `__init__.py` file has a particular behavior as it gathers all package-wide definitions (e.g., special values, documentation): it is always imported with the package.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import examples.hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter will look for `examples/__init__.py` and first execute its content. Then it will look for `examples/hello.py` and execute its top-level statements. After these operations, any variable, function, or class is available in the `example.hello` namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in complex projects, there may be sub-packages and sub-sub-packages in a deep directory structure. In this case, importing a single item from a sub-sub-package will require executing all `__init__.py` files down to the module.\n",
    "Leaving an `__init__.py` file (almost) empty is considered standard and even good practice if the package’s modules and sub-packages do not need to share any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, Python provides a convenient syntax for importing deeply nested packages: `import very.deep.module as mod`. This allows you to use `mod` in place of the long list of packages.\n",

In this case you will have to resort to fragile hacks such as using import statements inside your methods or functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Write tests for parts that have the fewest dependencies on external resources first, and work your way up.\n",
    "- Tests should be logically as simple as possible.\n",
    "- Each unit test should be independent of all other tests.\n",
    "- Each unit test should be clearly named and well documented.\n",
    "- All methods, regardless of visibility, should have appropriate Python unit tests.\n",
    "- Strive for one assertion per test case.\n",
    "- Create unit tests that cover exceptions.\n",
    "- DO write tests concurrently with code. DO NOT \"leave tests for later\".\n",

    "__Test Driven Development__: for each new functionality that your application must have, you first design Python unit tests and only then do you carry on writing the code that will implement this feature. TDD may seem like developing Python applications upside-down, but it has some benefits. For example, it ensures that you won't overlook unit testing for some feature. Further, developing test-first will help you to focus first on the tasks a certain function, test suite, or test case should achieve, and only afterwards to deal with how to implement that function, test suite, or test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you do have tests, it is really easy to check your code periodically or as new functionality is added. This is called __continuous integration/continuous development__ workflow (CI/CD). The testing is just the CI part. \n",

    "## 3. Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways to document code. Use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document design and purpose, not mechanics.\n",
    "- Document interfaces and reasons, not implementations.\n",
    "- Refactor code in preference to explaining how it works: i.e., rather than write a paragraph to explain a complex piece of code, reorganize the code itself so that it doesn't need such an explanation. This may not always be possible—some pieces of code are intrinsically difficult—but the onus should always be on the author to convince his or her peers of that.\n",
    "- Embed the documentation for a piece of software in that software: Doing this increases the probability that when programmers change the code, they will update the documentation at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### README\n",
    "\n",
    "The first piece of documentation a user may encounter is the README.md file. This file lives in the root directory of your project, is usually written in `md` or `rst` and should contain the following basic info:\n",
    "- What does this code do?\n",
    "- Who wrote it?\n",
    "- How does it get installed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Links to other related resources: documentation pages, related packages, papers that use it. \n",
    "- How to contribute (also see CONTRIBUTING.md)?\n",
    "- Changelog (can also be a separate file) containing a short overview of changes by version. This information can be captured by the commit history but it is good to have a short summary.\n",
    "- Sometimes you will see to-do lists but this should be in the issue tracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "The docstring describes the operation of the function or class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This function slows down program execution for some reason.\n",
    "def square_and_rooter(x):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Returns the square root of self times self.\"\"\"\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike block comments, docstrings are built into the Python language itself. This means you can use all of Python’s powerful introspection capabilities to access docstrings at runtime, compared with comments which are optimized out. Docstrings are accessible from both the __doc__ dunder attribute for almost every Python object, as well as with the built in help() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "While block comments are usually used to explain what a section of code is doing, or the specifics of an algorithm, docstrings are more intended towards explaining other users of your code (or you in 6 months time) how a particular function can be used and the general purpose of a function, class, or module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the complexity of the function, method, or class being written, a one-line docstring may be perfectly appropriate. These are generally used for really obvious cases, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Add two numbers and return the result.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The docstring should describe the function in a way that is easy to understand. For simple cases like trivial functions and classes, simply embedding the function’s signature (i.e. add(a, b) -> result) in the docstring is unnecessary. This is because with Python’s [`inspect`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inspect-module-in-python/) module, it is already quite easy to find this information if needed, and it is also readily available by reading the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> import inspect\n",
    "> print(inspect.getsource(add))\n",
    "> print(inspect.getdoc(add))\n",
    "> print(inspect.isfunction(add))\n",
    "\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In larger or more complex projects however, it is often a good idea to give more information about a function, what it does, any exceptions it may raise, what it returns, or relevant details about the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed documentation of code a popular style used, is the one used by the NumPy project, often called NumPy style docstrings. While it can take up more lines than the previous example, it allows the developer to include a lot more information about a method, function, or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def random_number_generator(arg1, arg2):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Summary line.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extended description of function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    arg1 : int\n",
    "        Description of arg1\n",
    "    arg2 : str\n",
    "        Description of arg2\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns\n",
    "    -------\n",
    "    int\n",
    "        Description of return value\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return 42 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many text editors will come with an extension that helps you generate docstrings. [This](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) is the one for VSCode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiled Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have docstrings in the location and format that Python expects them, you can autogenerate documentation. This is usually done with the `sphinx` library. You can add narrative documentation to that as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `docs` directory at the top level of your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir docs\n",
    "cd docs\n",
    "pip install sphinx\n",
    "sphinx-quickstart\n",
    "make html\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html#setting-up-the-documentation-sources) uses restructured text which is just enough different from markdown to be confusing. Look at the docs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The docs can have their own dependencies that need to be documented in the `setup.cfg` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Documentation:\n",
    "[options.extras_require]\n",
    "docs =\n",
    "  sphinx\n",
    "  sphinx-automodapi\n",
    "  numpydoc\n",
